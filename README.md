## 🧮 Comfort Index Formula

The Comfort Index is a **0-100 score** that quantifies how pleasant weather conditions feel to humans. Higher scores indicate more comfortable conditions.

### Formula Breakdown

```javascript
comfortIndex = (tempScore × 0.4) + (humidityScore × 0.3) + 
               (windScore × 0.2) + (cloudScore × 0.1)
```

### Component Calculations

| Component | Ideal Value | Calculation | Range |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **Temperature** | 22°C (72°F) | `100 - |22 - temp| × 3` | 0-100 |
| **Humidity** | 50% | `100 - |50 - humidity| × 2` | 0-100 |
| **Wind Speed** | 0 m/s | `100 - wind × 10` | 0-100 |
| **Cloud Cover** | 0% | `100 - clouds` | 0-100 |

### Example Calculation

**Input:**
- Temperature: 24°C
- Humidity: 60%
- Wind: 3 m/s
- Clouds: 20%

**Process:**
```
tempScore     = 100 - |22-24| × 3 = 100 - 6 = 94
humidityScore = 100 - |50-60| × 2 = 100 - 20 = 80
windScore     = 100 - 3 × 10 = 70
cloudScore    = 100 - 20 = 80

comfortIndex  = (94 × 0.4) + (80 × 0.3) + (70 × 0.2) + (80 × 0.1)
              = 37.6 + 24 + 14 + 8
              = 83.6 ≈ 84
```

## ⚖️ Variable Weights Reasoning

The weights are based on human comfort research and physiological impact:

### 🌡️ Temperature: 40% weight
**Why it's highest:**
- Most immediate impact on human comfort
- Body thermoregulation is critical for wellbeing
- Studies show temperature affects productivity, mood, and health
- Extreme deviations quickly become unbearable

### 💧 Humidity: 30% weight
**Why it's second:**
- Strongly affects perceived temperature (heat index)
- High humidity prevents sweat evaporation (cooling failure)
- Low humidity causes respiratory discomfort
- Significant but secondary to actual temperature

### 💨 Wind Speed: 20% weight
**Why it's third:**
- Modifies perceived temperature (wind chill)
- Light breezes can be pleasant; strong winds disruptive
- Less impactful than temp/humidity in typical conditions
- Becomes critical only at extremes

### ☁️ Cloud Cover: 10% weight
**Why it's lowest:**
- Aesthetic preference varies culturally
- Indirect impact (affects temperature/UV)
- Many people don't mind clouds
- Least physiological effect

## 🔄 Trade-offs Considered

### 1. **Linear vs. Non-linear Penalties**
- ✅ **Chose:** Linear penalties with multipliers
- ❌ **Rejected:** Exponential/quadratic curves
- **Reasoning:** Simpler to understand and tune. Extreme values are rare enough that linear suffices.

### 2. **Fixed vs. Dynamic Weights**
- ✅ **Chose:** Fixed weights (0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1)
- ❌ **Rejected:** Context-aware weights (e.g., higher wind weight in winter)
- **Reasoning:** Predictability and simplicity. Can add seasonal adjustments later.

### 3. **Ideal Values**
- ✅ **Chose:** 22°C, 50% humidity, 0 m/s wind, 0% clouds
- ❌ **Rejected:** User-customizable ideals
- **Reasoning:** Research-backed "universal comfort zone." Personalization is a future enhancement.

### 4. **Score Flooring**
- ✅ **Chose:** `Math.max(0, ...)` to prevent negative scores
- ❌ **Rejected:** Allowing negatives or uncapped penalties
- **Reasoning:** 0-100 scale is intuitive. Negative scores confuse UX.

### 5. **Precision**
- ✅ **Chose:** `Math.round()` for integer scores
- ❌ **Rejected:** Decimal precision (e.g., 84.6)
- **Reasoning:** Users don't need sub-point accuracy. Cleaner API responses.

## 🗄️ Cache Design

### Architecture

The API uses **NodeCache** for in-memory caching to reduce redundant API calls and improve response times.

```javascript
// Cache Configuration
import NodeCache from "node-cache";

export const weatherCache = new NodeCache({ 
  stdTTL: 300  // 5 minutes time-to-live
});
```

### Why 5 Minutes?
- Weather data updates every 10-15 minutes at most APIs
- Balances freshness vs. performance
- Prevents rate limiting on weather data providers
- Short enough to feel "real-time" to users

### Cache Middleware Flow

```
Request → Check Cache → HIT? → Return cached data
                      ↓ MISS
                      Fetch fresh data → Store in cache → Return data
```

**Implementation:**
```javascript
export const cacheMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  const key = req.originalUrl;  // URL as cache key

  // Cache hit
  if (weatherCache.has(key)) {
    return res.json({
      cache: "HIT",
      data: weatherCache.get(key)
    });
  }

  // Cache miss - intercept response
  res.sendResponse = res.json;
  res.json = (body) => {
    weatherCache.set(key, body);  // Store for next request
    res.sendResponse(body);
  };

  next();
};
```

### Cache Monitoring

Check cache health via the status endpoint:

```bash
GET /cache/status
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "keys": ["weather_london", "weather_tokyo"],
  "stats": {
    "hits": 127,
    "misses": 45,
    "keys": 2,
    "ksize": 1024
  }
}
```

### Design Benefits
- ✅ **Performance:** 100-500ms faster responses on cache hits
- ✅ **Cost Savings:** Reduces external API calls (important for paid tiers)
- ✅ **Scalability:** Handles traffic spikes without backend stress
- ✅ **Reliability:** Works even if weather API is slow

### Trade-offs
- ❌ **Memory Usage:** Stores data in RAM (limited by server)
- ❌ **Stale Data Risk:** 5-minute window may show outdated weather
- ❌ **No Persistence:** Cache lost on server restart

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### 1. **Subjective Comfort**
- Formula uses universal ideals, but comfort is personal
- Doesn't account for age, health, acclimatization
- **Future:** Add user preference multipliers

### 2. **Incomplete Weather Factors**
- Ignores: UV index, precipitation, air quality, pressure
- These can significantly affect comfort
- **Future:** Expand to 8-10 factor model

### 3. **No Seasonal Context**
- 15°C might be "warm" in winter, "cold" in summer
- Current model treats it the same year-round
- **Future:** Add seasonal baseline adjustments

### 4. **Wind Chill/Heat Index**
- Doesn't use combined indices (feels-like temperature)
- Simple linear wind penalty may undervalue extreme combinations
- **Future:** Integrate meteorological formulae

### 5. **Cache Invalidation**
- No smart invalidation (always waits 5 minutes)
- Extreme weather changes might not update fast enough
- **Future:** Add event-based invalidation

### 6. **Geographic Assumptions**
- 22°C ideal is Western/temperate bias
- Tropical vs. Arctic populations have different norms
- **Future:** Location-based ideal adjustments

### 7. **Single Point in Time**
- Doesn't consider forecast trends
- "Getting better" vs. "getting worse" affects perception
- **Future:** Add trend indicators
